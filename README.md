Good and Interesting Aspects of UI Design
- The GUI is minimal and only appears when necessary to prevent confusion. For example, the “Play Recording” button only appears when all the letters disappear from the screen.
- All buttons have a shaking/enlarging animation when hovered, to add to the fun nature of the app.
- When the input text is longer than the screen, the letters dynamically fill to the next line in the scream page.
- To add to the dynamic feel, even the home page text has a nice hovering CSS animation!
- The website will throw errors when necessary, such as when the user inputs no text and they press submit.
- The user can go to the previous page even if they haven’t finished screaming, which resets the letters and stops the audio from recording.
